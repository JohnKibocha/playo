# Playo

## Overview
Playo is a multi-page web application designed to connect sports enthusiasts, book venues, and track fitness goals. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

## Prerequisites
- A locally installed web server or the ability to serve static files.
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is referenced via a CDN.

## Project Structure
- `playo/templates/`: Contains HTML templates (e.g. `home.html`, `play.html`, etc.).
- `playo/styles/`: Holds CSS files (e.g. `styles.css`).
- `playo/scripts/`: Includes JavaScript files (e.g. `script.js`).
- `readme.md`: Documentation file (this file).
